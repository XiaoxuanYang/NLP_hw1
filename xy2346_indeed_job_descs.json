This project isn\u2019t greenfield in the way most banks claim projects are; we\u2019ve started with a blank sheet of paper both operationally and technically. We\u2019re using the same technologies that Silicon Valley giants are using: aggressive use of multiple public clouds, building our own private cloud to achieve even better performance, pushing out microservices into what will be one of the largest Kubernetes installations in the world, leveraging immutable storage to process and store hundreds of terabytes of data a day, transforming our industry through application of distributed ledger technology and cognitive computing, aggressively participating in open source communities driving our systems.\n\nWho we are\nAlthough not a household name, State Street is one of the world\u2019s largest and most important financial services institutions, providing round-the-clock services to the global investment community.
