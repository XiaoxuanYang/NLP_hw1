You should be comfortable working with your team to craft a design: choosing the appropriate technology and designing a solution that both answers the problem at hand, and stays within constraints. * Coding. Our Leads never go post-technical. We think that it\u2019s important for technical leadership to continue to code. Our clients don\u2019t all work in one language or platform, and neither do we.

You should be very comfortable working with Agile, Lean and Continuous Delivery practices - and love it as much as we do. Soft Skills * Mentoring a team and bringing them up to speed on new languages and skills. We all learn from each other, but with the breadth of technical experience you\u2019ll bring to the table, you\u2019ll be an invaluable teacher to your less-experienced peers. * Thinking big and acting fast. You\u2019ll need a startup mentality with enterprise awareness. That means you can manage competing priorities, that you\u2019re ready to pivot or adjust plans quickly, and that you understand the role you and your team play in major organizations\u2019 tech strategies. * Influencing priorities, for both the team and the client. You understand both the business problem and the technical solution, and you\u2019re able to advocate for excellence and effect change when necessary. * Finesse. As consultants, we navigate within our client\u2019s organizations to influence big decision makers and win trust. In this job, you\u2019ll be using your people skills as much as your coding skills. And here\u2019s some of the perks of being part of a unique organization like ThoughtWorks. - * A real commitment to \u201cchanging the face of IT\u201d - our way of thinking about diversity and inclusion. Over the past ten years, we\u2019ve implemented a lot of initiatives to make ThoughtWorks a place that reflects the world around us, and to make this a welcoming home to technologists of all stripes. We\u2019re not perfect, but we\u2019re actively working towards true gender balance for our business and our industry, and you\u2019ll see that diversity reflected on our project teams and in offices. * Continuous learning. You\u2019ll be constantly exposed to new languages, frameworks and ideas from your peers and as you work on different projects - challenging you to stay at the top of your game. * No pigeon-holing: at ThoughtWorks, there\u2019s no applying to new roles. With time, you\u2019ll build trust and credibility and move easily into new roles if you\u2019re inclined, like trying out life in a QA or BA\u2019s shoes. * Miles on miles. As consultants, we travel to the client sites every week. At first, you\u2019ll likely travel domestically, but with time, you\u2019ll find opportunities to travel around the world (and rack up some major points along the way.) * Support to grow as a technologist outside of your role at ThoughtWorks. This is why ThoughtWorkers have written over 100 books and can be found speaking at (and, ahem, keynoting) tech conferences all over the world. We love to learn and share knowledge, and you\u2019ll find a community of passionate technologists eager to back your endeavors, whatever they may be. You\u2019ll also receive financial support to attend conferences every year. * An organizational commitment to social responsibility. ThoughtWorkers challenge each other to be just a little more thoughtful about the world around us, and we believe in using our profits for good. All around the world, you\u2019ll find ThoughtWorks supporting great causes and organizations in both official and unofficial capacities. A few important things to know: - * Travel is required. Projects are almost exclusively on customer site, so ThoughtWorkers need to be flexible and up for extensive travel. Most of our consultants travel every week and fly home for weekends. We do our best to take people\u2019s personal situations into account, but we know it\u2019s not for everyone. * Residing near one of our North America offices in Chicago, Dallas, New York, Atlanta or San Francisco is preferable although not necessary.

You should be comfortable working with your team to craft a design: choosing the appropriate technology and designing a solution that both answers the problem at hand, and stays within constraints. * Coding. Our Leads never go post-technical. We think that it\u2019s important for technical leadership to continue to code. Our clients don\u2019t all work in one language or platform, and neither do we.

You're no stranger to shipping code to production and you've acquired a foundational knowledge of software development because of it.\n\nBut somewhere along the way you realized that sometimes the pen is mightier than the IDE. Through writing technical blog posts, documentation, support tickets, or even READMEs you realized the power \u2014 and challenge \u2014 of writing technical content. You understand that the devil is in the details: accuracy, conciseness, and relevance. But you've also felt that unique satisfaction when a fellow developer learns something new thanks to what you wrote.\n\nBeyond just writing, you may have also discovered that you're motivated by teaching your peers face-to-face as well.\n\nThrough either setting, you've probably wondered if our industry's standards for documentation and training are really the best they can be. And you're excited at the thought of pushing beyond those standards to discover new ways to educate developers.\n\nWhat\n\nAs a Developer Educator at Twilio, your job is to challenge and empower developers to build the future of communications.\n\nYou will do this primarily through technical documentation, focusing on one of Twilio's major products: Voice or Messaging. You will own the experience for that product's documentation, from API reference docs to sample application tutorials to the UX for those docs on twilio.com.\n\nAs part of these duties you may find yourself rewriting a low-rated page, building a new sample application, authoring new tutorials, assisting with the launch of a new feature, or reviewing the work of a fellow Developer Educator or our external contributors.\n\nIn addition, you'll own and expand your product's exercises in TwilioQuest ( https://www.twilio.com/quest ), Twilio's video game / training platform. You'll also attend and possibly lead a few of our Superclass ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6Gwjk7JcTk ) training events, including at SIGNAL, our annual conference in San Francisco.\n\nFinally, you'll occasionally build new features for the platform which powers Twilio's documentation and TwilioQuest. And you'll take a shift every 6 weeks in our on-call rotation for our corner of twilio.com.\n\nWhy\n\nTwilio's mission is to fuel the future of communications.\n\nThe Developer Network is the team at Twilio whose mission is to catalyze the network of developers who will build the future of communications. The DevNet is comprised of three teams that work closely with one another. Developer Evangelists inspire and equip developers by going to the language-centric and geographic communities where developers gather. Developer Educators challenge and empower developers by crafting world-class docs and training. Community Developers encourage and amplify developers by cultivating a core community of Twilio developers. Together, these three teams introduce developers to Twilio, help them get their projects shipped and build strong end enduring friendships with them.\n\nTwilio is a company committed to your growth, your learning, your development and your entire employee experience. We only win when our employees succeed and we're dedicated to helping you develop your strengths. We have a cultural foundation built on diversity, inclusion and innovation that we believe only gets better when your ideas thrive.\n\nWhere\n\nThis is a remote position. You can be based in a major metro area. While working remote you will still enjoy our incredible perks: a free Kindle when you build your Twilio app, monthly Kindle book reimbursement, monthly gym reimbursement, bi-weekly All Hands and more. Between our Superclass training events and team meetings, you will be expected to travel 1-2 times per quarter. We also believe that in order to do this job well, you need a balanced work and home life. We offer generous PTO.

They\u2019ve also been writing books, speaking at conferences, and helping push software development forward - changing companies and even industries along the way. As consultants, we work on-site with our clients to ensure we\u2019re delivering the best possible solution. Our Lead Dev plays an important role in leading these projects to success. Curious what makes a developer a Lead around these parts? A lead is: * Often the day-to-day primary point of contact with our clients * Able to strategically lead a project team to successful delivery * Excited to mentor, influence and lead a team of ThoughtWorkers and clients * An expert in at least one language or domain, and maybe in 2 or more We believe that to flourish in this role, you're good at: - Technical Skills * Architecture. You should be comfortable working with your team to craft a design: choosing the appropriate technology and designing a solution that both answers the problem at hand, and stays within constraints. * Coding. Our Leads never go post-technical. We think that it\u2019s important for technical leadership to continue to code. Our clients don\u2019t all work in one language or platform, and neither do we. As a lead, we\u2019re looking for a breadth of experience in a lot of languages, and expertise in one or two: Java, javascript, and Ruby are high on our list. (Other notables: Python, Scala, .NET, Clojure.) You should also be up to speed on practices like TDD, continuous integration, pairing, and infrastructure automation. * Understanding and often playing a major part in the entire cycle of software consulting and delivery, from ideation, to project conception, to UX, to code, to testing, to deployment, and around again. * Agile. We believe strongly in agile delivery practices, having implemented them for ourselves and our clients for a long time now. You should be very comfortable working with Agile, Lean and Continuous Delivery practices - and love it as much as we do. Soft Skills * Mentoring a team and bringing them up to speed on new languages and skills. We all learn from each other, but with the breadth of technical experience you\u2019ll bring to the table, you\u2019ll be an invaluable teacher to your less-experienced peers. * Thinking big and acting fast. You\u2019ll need a startup mentality with enterprise awareness. That means you can manage competing priorities, that you\u2019re ready to pivot or adjust plans quickly, and that you understand the role you and your team play in major organizations\u2019 tech strategies. * Influencing priorities, for both the team and the client. You understand both the business problem and the technical solution, and you\u2019re able to advocate for excellence and effect change when necessary. * Finesse. As consultants, we navigate within our client\u2019s organizations to influence big decision makers and win trust. In this job, you\u2019ll be using your people skills as much as your coding skills. And here\u2019s some of the perks of being part of a unique organization like ThoughtWorks. - * A real commitment to \u201cchanging the face of IT\u201d - our way of thinking about diversity and inclusion. Over the past ten years, we\u2019ve implemented a lot of initiatives to make ThoughtWorks a place that reflects the world around us, and to make this a welcoming home to technologists of all stripes. We\u2019re not perfect, but we\u2019re actively working towards true gender balance for our business and our industry, and you\u2019ll see that diversity reflected on our project teams and in offices. * Continuous learning. You\u2019ll be constantly exposed to new languages, frameworks and ideas from your peers and as you work on different projects - challenging you to stay at the top of your game. * No pigeon-holing: at ThoughtWorks, there\u2019s no applying to new roles. With time, you\u2019ll build trust and credibility and move easily into new roles if you\u2019re inclined, like trying out life in a QA or BA\u2019s shoes. * Miles on miles. As consultants, we travel to the client sites every week. At first, you\u2019ll likely travel domestically, but with time, you\u2019ll find opportunities to travel around the world (and rack up some major points along the way.) * Support to grow as a technologist outside of your role at ThoughtWorks. This is why ThoughtWorkers have written over 100 books and can be found speaking at (and, ahem, keynoting) tech conferences all over the world. We love to learn and share knowledge, and you\u2019ll find a community of passionate technologists eager to back your endeavors, whatever they may be. You\u2019ll also receive financial support to attend conferences every year. * An organizational commitment to social responsibility. ThoughtWorkers challenge each other to be just a little more thoughtful about the world around us, and we believe in using our profits for good. All around the world, you\u2019ll find ThoughtWorks supporting great causes and organizations in both official and unofficial capacities. A few important things to know: - * Travel is required. Projects are almost exclusively on customer site, so ThoughtWorkers need to be flexible and up for extensive travel. Most of our consultants travel every week and fly home for weekends. We do our best to take people\u2019s personal situations into account, but we know it\u2019s not for everyone. * Residing near one of our North America offices in Chicago, Dallas, New York, Atlanta or San Francisco is preferable although not necessary. Not quite ready to apply? Or maybe this isn\u2019t the right role for you?

You should be very comfortable working with Agile, Lean and Continuous Delivery practices - and love it as much as we do. Soft Skills * Mentoring a team and bringing them up to speed on new languages and skills. We all learn from each other, but with the breadth of technical experience you\u2019ll bring to the table, you\u2019ll be an invaluable teacher to your less-experienced peers. * Thinking big and acting fast. You\u2019ll need a startup mentality with enterprise awareness. That means you can manage competing priorities, that you\u2019re ready to pivot or adjust plans quickly, and that you understand the role you and your team play in major organizations\u2019 tech strategies. * Influencing priorities, for both the team and the client. You understand both the business problem and the technical solution, and you\u2019re able to advocate for excellence and effect change when necessary. * Finesse. As consultants, we navigate within our client\u2019s organizations to influence big decision makers and win trust. In this job, you\u2019ll be using your people skills as much as your coding skills. And here\u2019s some of the perks of being part of a unique organization like ThoughtWorks. - * A real commitment to \u201cchanging the face of IT\u201d - our way of thinking about diversity and inclusion. Over the past ten years, we\u2019ve implemented a lot of initiatives to make ThoughtWorks a place that reflects the world around us, and to make this a welcoming home to technologists of all stripes. We\u2019re not perfect, but we\u2019re actively working towards true gender balance for our business and our industry, and you\u2019ll see that diversity reflected on our project teams and in offices. * Continuous learning. You\u2019ll be constantly exposed to new languages, frameworks and ideas from your peers and as you work on different projects - challenging you to stay at the top of your game. * No pigeon-holing: at ThoughtWorks, there\u2019s no applying to new roles. With time, you\u2019ll build trust and credibility and move easily into new roles if you\u2019re inclined, like trying out life in a QA or BA\u2019s shoes. * Miles on miles. As consultants, we travel to the client sites every week. At first, you\u2019ll likely travel domestically, but with time, you\u2019ll find opportunities to travel around the world (and rack up some major points along the way.) * Support to grow as a technologist outside of your role at ThoughtWorks. This is why ThoughtWorkers have written over 100 books and can be found speaking at (and, ahem, keynoting) tech conferences all over the world. We love to learn and share knowledge, and you\u2019ll find a community of passionate technologists eager to back your endeavors, whatever they may be. You\u2019ll also receive financial support to attend conferences every year. * An organizational commitment to social responsibility. ThoughtWorkers challenge each other to be just a little more thoughtful about the world around us, and we believe in using our profits for good. All around the world, you\u2019ll find ThoughtWorks supporting great causes and organizations in both official and unofficial capacities. A few important things to know: - * Travel is required. Projects are almost exclusively on customer site, so ThoughtWorkers need to be flexible and up for extensive travel. Most of our consultants travel every week and fly home for weekends. We do our best to take people\u2019s personal situations into account, but we know it\u2019s not for everyone. * Residing near one of our North America offices in Chicago, Dallas, New York, Atlanta or San Francisco is preferable although not necessary. Not quite ready to apply? Or maybe this isn\u2019t the right role for you? That\u2019s OK, you can stay in touch with AccessThoughtWorks ( https://www.thoughtworks.com/careers/access?utm_source=apply-jobs&utm_medium=jd&utm_campaign=access-thoughtworks ), our learning community (tick 'contact me about recruitment opportunities' to hear about jobs in the future).

They\u2019ve also been writing books, speaking at conferences, and helping push software development forward - changing companies and even industries along the way. As consultants, we work on-site with our clients to ensure we\u2019re delivering the best possible solution. Our Lead Dev plays an important role in leading these projects to success. Curious what makes a developer a Lead around these parts? A lead is: * Often the day-to-day primary point of contact with our clients * Able to strategically lead a project team to successful delivery * Excited to mentor, influence and lead a team of ThoughtWorkers and clients * An expert in at least one language or domain, and maybe in 2 or more We believe that to flourish in this role, you're good at: - Technical Skills * Architecture. You should be comfortable working with your team to craft a design: choosing the appropriate technology and designing a solution that both answers the problem at hand, and stays within constraints. * Coding. Our Leads never go post-technical. We think that it\u2019s important for technical leadership to continue to code. Our clients don\u2019t all work in one language or platform, and neither do we. As a lead, we\u2019re looking for a breadth of experience in a lot of languages, and expertise in one or two: Java, javascript, and Ruby are high on our list. (Other notables: Python, Scala, .NET, Clojure.) You should also be up to speed on practices like TDD, continuous integration, pairing, and infrastructure automation. * Understanding and often playing a major part in the entire cycle of software consulting and delivery, from ideation, to project conception, to UX, to code, to testing, to deployment, and around again. * Agile. We believe strongly in agile delivery practices, having implemented them for ourselves and our clients for a long time now. You should be very comfortable working with Agile, Lean and Continuous Delivery practices - and love it as much as we do. Soft Skills * Mentoring a team and bringing them up to speed on new languages and skills. We all learn from each other, but with the breadth of technical experience you\u2019ll bring to the table, you\u2019ll be an invaluable teacher to your less-experienced peers. * Thinking big and acting fast. You\u2019ll need a startup mentality with enterprise awareness. That means you can manage competing priorities, that you\u2019re ready to pivot or adjust plans quickly, and that you understand the role you and your team play in major organizations\u2019 tech strategies. * Influencing priorities, for both the team and the client. You understand both the business problem and the technical solution, and you\u2019re able to advocate for excellence and effect change when necessary. * Finesse. As consultants, we navigate within our client\u2019s organizations to influence big decision makers and win trust. In this job, you\u2019ll be using your people skills as much as your coding skills. And here\u2019s some of the perks of being part of a unique organization like ThoughtWorks. - * A real commitment to \u201cchanging the face of IT\u201d - our way of thinking about diversity and inclusion. Over the past ten years, we\u2019ve implemented a lot of initiatives to make ThoughtWorks a place that reflects the world around us, and to make this a welcoming home to technologists of all stripes. We\u2019re not perfect, but we\u2019re actively working towards true gender balance for our business and our industry, and you\u2019ll see that diversity reflected on our project teams and in offices. * Continuous learning. You\u2019ll be constantly exposed to new languages, frameworks and ideas from your peers and as you work on different projects - challenging you to stay at the top of your game. * No pigeon-holing: at ThoughtWorks, there\u2019s no applying to new roles. With time, you\u2019ll build trust and credibility and move easily into new roles if you\u2019re inclined, like trying out life in a QA or BA\u2019s shoes. * Miles on miles. As consultants, we travel to the client sites every week. At first, you\u2019ll likely travel domestically, but with time, you\u2019ll find opportunities to travel around the world (and rack up some major points along the way.) * Support to grow as a technologist outside of your role at ThoughtWorks. This is why ThoughtWorkers have written over 100 books and can be found speaking at (and, ahem, keynoting) tech conferences all over the world. We love to learn and share knowledge, and you\u2019ll find a community of passionate technologists eager to back your endeavors, whatever they may be. You\u2019ll also receive financial support to attend conferences every year. * An organizational commitment to social responsibility. ThoughtWorkers challenge each other to be just a little more thoughtful about the world around us, and we believe in using our profits for good. All around the world, you\u2019ll find ThoughtWorks supporting great causes and organizations in both official and unofficial capacities. A few important things to know: - * Travel is required. Projects are almost exclusively on customer site, so ThoughtWorkers need to be flexible and up for extensive travel. Most of our consultants travel every week and fly home for weekends. We do our best to take people\u2019s personal situations into account, but we know it\u2019s not for everyone. * Residing near one of our North America offices in Chicago, Dallas, New York, Atlanta or San Francisco is preferable although not necessary.

They\u2019ve also been writing books, speaking at conferences, and helping push software development forward - changing companies and even industries along the way. As consultants, we work on-site with our clients to ensure we\u2019re delivering the best possible solution. Our Lead Dev plays an important role in leading these projects to success. Curious what makes a developer a Lead around these parts? A lead is: * Often the day-to-day primary point of contact with our clients * Able to strategically lead a project team to successful delivery * Excited to mentor, influence and lead a team of ThoughtWorkers and clients * An expert in at least one language or domain, and maybe in 2 or more We believe that to flourish in this role, you're good at: - Technical Skills * Architecture. You should be comfortable working with your team to craft a design: choosing the appropriate technology and designing a solution that both answers the problem at hand, and stays within constraints. * Coding. Our Leads never go post-technical. We think that it\u2019s important for technical leadership to continue to code. Our clients don\u2019t all work in one language or platform, and neither do we. As a lead, we\u2019re looking for a breadth of experience in a lot of languages, and expertise in one or two: Java, javascript, and Ruby are high on our list. (Other notables: Python, Scala, .NET, Clojure.) You should also be up to speed on practices like TDD, continuous integration, pairing, and infrastructure automation. * Understanding and often playing a major part in the entire cycle of software consulting and delivery, from ideation, to project conception, to UX, to code, to testing, to deployment, and around again. * Agile. We believe strongly in agile delivery practices, having implemented them for ourselves and our clients for a long time now. You should be very comfortable working with Agile, Lean and Continuous Delivery practices - and love it as much as we do. Soft Skills * Mentoring a team and bringing them up to speed on new languages and skills. We all learn from each other, but with the breadth of technical experience you\u2019ll bring to the table, you\u2019ll be an invaluable teacher to your less-experienced peers. * Thinking big and acting fast. You\u2019ll need a startup mentality with enterprise awareness. That means you can manage competing priorities, that you\u2019re ready to pivot or adjust plans quickly, and that you understand the role you and your team play in major organizations\u2019 tech strategies. * Influencing priorities, for both the team and the client. You understand both the business problem and the technical solution, and you\u2019re able to advocate for excellence and effect change when necessary. * Finesse. As consultants, we navigate within our client\u2019s organizations to influence big decision makers and win trust. In this job, you\u2019ll be using your people skills as much as your coding skills. And here\u2019s some of the perks of being part of a unique organization like ThoughtWorks. - * A real commitment to \u201cchanging the face of IT\u201d - our way of thinking about diversity and inclusion. Over the past ten years, we\u2019ve implemented a lot of initiatives to make ThoughtWorks a place that reflects the world around us, and to make this a welcoming home to technologists of all stripes. We\u2019re not perfect, but we\u2019re actively working towards true gender balance for our business and our industry, and you\u2019ll see that diversity reflected on our project teams and in offices. * Continuous learning. You\u2019ll be constantly exposed to new languages, frameworks and ideas from your peers and as you work on different projects - challenging you to stay at the top of your game. * No pigeon-holing: at ThoughtWorks, there\u2019s no applying to new roles. With time, you\u2019ll build trust and credibility and move easily into new roles if you\u2019re inclined, like trying out life in a QA or BA\u2019s shoes. * Miles on miles. As consultants, we travel to the client sites every week. At first, you\u2019ll likely travel domestically, but with time, you\u2019ll find opportunities to travel around the world (and rack up some major points along the way.) * Support to grow as a technologist outside of your role at ThoughtWorks. This is why ThoughtWorkers have written over 100 books and can be found speaking at (and, ahem, keynoting) tech conferences all over the world. We love to learn and share knowledge, and you\u2019ll find a community of passionate technologists eager to back your endeavors, whatever they may be. You\u2019ll also receive financial support to attend conferences every year. * An organizational commitment to social responsibility. ThoughtWorkers challenge each other to be just a little more thoughtful about the world around us, and we believe in using our profits for good. All around the world, you\u2019ll find ThoughtWorks supporting great causes and organizations in both official and unofficial capacities. A few important things to know: - * Travel is required. Projects are almost exclusively on customer site, so ThoughtWorkers need to be flexible and up for extensive travel. Most of our consultants travel every week and fly home for weekends. We do our best to take people\u2019s personal situations into account, but we know it\u2019s not for everyone. * Residing near one of our North America offices in Chicago, Dallas, New York, Atlanta or San Francisco is preferable although not necessary.

Such messages are violations of Twilio's acceptable use policy and are often also violations of US law. Accordingly, Twilio has an obligation to stop such messages. We need to identify customers sending spam so that we can help the customer to prevent additional spam. Then, in cases where the customer cannot or will not stop, we may then need to close the customer's account.\n\nResponsibilities\n\nSpecifically, this person would primarily be responsible for the following:\n\n\nMonitor several business intelligence reports that indicate that a customer may be sending spam\nWhen a customer appears to be sending spam, review that customer's outbound message logs to understand the nature of the content that the customer is sending (e.g., political campaign messages, marketing messages for a particular product)\nReview the customer's inbound message logs to (a) assess whether the outbound messages are unwanted and (b) gauge how angry or frustrated message recipients may be\nSearch the internet for information on the customer to see if there are any complaints of spam or other indicators of the nature of their messages\nAssess how message recipients may have opted in to receive messages, looking for deficiencies in the opt-in process\nGather basic information on the customer (e.g., how much the customer is spending, how long the customer has been using Twilio's service)\nIf the customer appears to be sending spam, then this role would:\nGather the relevant metrics and information into a report\nShare the report with the relevant Twilio customer account manager\nWork with the Twilio account manager and the customer to address the spam issue by recommending best practices\nMake a recommendation that Twilio suspend the customer's account if the customer will not or cannot stop sending spam\nOther related responsibilities as assigned\n\nRequirements\n\n\nAbility to work in a highly discrete and confidential manner because the person would have access to our customer's personal information\nGood judgment and good communications skills\nProficiency in working with computers (e.g., use a web browser, click through menus, log into a VPN) and proficiency in quickly learning how to use web-based software programs\nIntermediate proficiency in reviewing data and tables\nIntermediate proficiency in MS Excel and/or Google Sheets\nAbility to work on tasks independently\n\nAbout us:\nMore than 2 million developers around the world have used Twilio to unlock the magic of communications to improve any human experience.

They've also been writing books, speaking at conferences, and helping push software development forward -- changing companies and even industries along the way.\n\nAs consultants, we work on-site with our clients to ensure we're delivering the best possible solution. Our Lead Dev plays an important role in leading these projects to success.\n\nCurious what makes a developer a Lead around these parts? A lead is:\n\n\nOften the day-to-day primary point of contact with our clients\nAble to strategically lead a project team to successful delivery\nExcited to mentor, influence and lead a team of ThoughtWorkers and clients\nAn expert in at least one language or domain, and maybe in 2 or more\n\nWe believe that to flourish in this role, you're good at:\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nTechnical Skills\n\n\nArchitecture. You should be comfortable working with your team to craft a design: choosing the appropriate technology and designing a solution that both answers the problem at hand, and stays within constraints.\nCoding. Our Leads never go post-technical. We think that it's important for technical leadership to continue to code. Our clients don't all work in one language or platform, and neither do we. As a lead, we're looking for a breadth of experience in a lot of languages, and expertise in one or two: Java, javascript, and Ruby are high on our list. (Other notables: Python, Scala, .NET, Clojure.) You should also be up to speed on practices like TDD, continuous integration, pairing, and infrastructure automation.\nUnderstanding and often playing a major part in the entire cycle of software consulting and delivery, from ideation, to project conception, to UX, to code, to testing, to deployment, and around again.\nAgile. We believe strongly in agile delivery practices, having implemented them for ourselves and our clients for a long time now. You should be very comfortable working with Agile, Lean and Continuous Delivery practices -- and love it as much as we do.\n\nSoft Skills\n\n\nMentoring a team and bringing them up to speed on new languages and skills. We all learn from each other, but with the breadth of technical experience you'll bring to the table, you'll be an invaluable teacher to your less-experienced peers.\nThinking big and acting fast. You'll need a startup mentality with enterprise awareness. That means you can manage competing priorities, that you're ready to pivot or adjust plans quickly, and that you understand the role you and your team play in major organizations' tech strategies.\nInfluencing priorities, for both the team and the client. You understand both the business problem and the technical solution, and you're able to advocate for excellence and effect change when necessary.\nFinesse. As consultants, we navigate within our client's organizations to influence big decision makers and win trust. In this job, you'll be using your people skills as much as your coding skills.\n\nAnd here's some of the perks of being part of a unique organization like ThoughtWorks.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nA real commitment to \"changing the face of IT\" -- our way of thinking about diversity and inclusion. Over the past ten years, we've implemented a lot of initiatives to make ThoughtWorks a place that reflects the world around us, and to make this a welcoming home to technologists of all stripes. We're not perfect, but we're actively working towards true gender balance for our business and our industry, and you'll see that diversity reflected on our project teams and in offices.\nContinuous learning. You'll be constantly exposed to new languages, frameworks and ideas from your peers and as you work on different projects -- challenging you to stay at the top of your game.\nNo pigeon-holing: at ThoughtWorks, there's no applying to new roles. With time, you'll build trust and credibility and move easily into new roles if you're inclined, like trying out life in a QA or BA's shoes.\nMiles on miles. As consultants, we travel to the client sites every week. At first, you'll likely travel domestically, but with time, you'll find opportunities to travel around the world (and rack up some major points along the way.)\nSupport to grow as a technologist outside of your role at ThoughtWorks. This is why ThoughtWorkers have written over 100 books and can be found speaking at (and, ahem, keynoting) tech conferences all over the world. We love to learn and share knowledge, and you'll find a community of passionate technologists eager to back your endeavors, whatever they may be. You'll also receive financial support to attend conferences every year.\nAn organizational commitment to social responsibility. ThoughtWorkers challenge each other to be just a little more thoughtful about the world around us, and we believe in using our profits for good. All around the world, you'll find ThoughtWorks supporting great causes and organizations in both official and unofficial capacities.\n\nA few important things to know:\n-------------------------------\n\n\nTravel is required. Projects are almost exclusively on customer site, so ThoughtWorkers need to be flexible and up for extensive travel. Most of our consultants travel every week and fly home for weekends. We do our best to take people's personal situations into account, but we know it's not for everyone.\nResiding near one of our North America offices in Chicago, Dallas, New York, Atlanta or San Francisco is preferable although not necessary.\n\nNot quite ready to apply?

As consultants, we work on-site with our clients to ensure we\u2019re delivering the best possible solution. Our Lead Dev plays an important role in leading these projects to success. Curious what makes a developer a Lead around these parts? A lead is: * Often the day-to-day primary point of contact with our clients * Able to strategically lead a project team to successful delivery * Excited to mentor, influence and lead a team of ThoughtWorkers and clients * An expert in at least one language or domain, and maybe in 2 or more We believe that to flourish in this role, you're good at: - Technical Skills * Architecture. You should be comfortable working with your team to craft a design: choosing the appropriate technology and designing a solution that both answers the problem at hand, and stays within constraints. * Coding. Our Leads never go post-technical. We think that it\u2019s important for technical leadership to continue to code. Our clients don\u2019t all work in one language or platform, and neither do we. As a lead, we\u2019re looking for a breadth of experience in a lot of languages, and expertise in one or two: Java, javascript, and Ruby are high on our list. (Other notables: Python, Scala, .NET, Clojure.) You should also be up to speed on practices like TDD, continuous integration, pairing, and infrastructure automation. * Understanding and often playing a major part in the entire cycle of software consulting and delivery, from ideation, to project conception, to UX, to code, to testing, to deployment, and around again. * Agile. We believe strongly in agile delivery practices, having implemented them for ourselves and our clients for a long time now. You should be very comfortable working with Agile, Lean and Continuous Delivery practices - and love it as much as we do. Soft Skills * Mentoring a team and bringing them up to speed on new languages and skills. We all learn from each other, but with the breadth of technical experience you\u2019ll bring to the table, you\u2019ll be an invaluable teacher to your less-experienced peers. * Thinking big and acting fast. You\u2019ll need a startup mentality with enterprise awareness. That means you can manage competing priorities, that you\u2019re ready to pivot or adjust plans quickly, and that you understand the role you and your team play in major organizations\u2019 tech strategies. * Influencing priorities, for both the team and the client. You understand both the business problem and the technical solution, and you\u2019re able to advocate for excellence and effect change when necessary. * Finesse. As consultants, we navigate within our client\u2019s organizations to influence big decision makers and win trust. In this job, you\u2019ll be using your people skills as much as your coding skills.

We\u2019re not perfect, but we\u2019re actively working towards true gender balance for our business and our industry, and you\u2019ll see that diversity reflected on our project teams and in offices. * Continuous learning.

With time, you\u2019ll build trust and credibility and move easily into new roles if you\u2019re inclined, like trying out life in a QA or BA\u2019s shoes. * Miles on miles. As consultants, we travel to the client sites every week. At first, you\u2019ll likely travel domestically, but with time, you\u2019ll find opportunities to travel around the world (and rack up some major points along the way.) * Support to grow as a technologist outside of your role at ThoughtWorks. This is why ThoughtWorkers have written over 100 books and can be found speaking at (and, ahem, keynoting) tech conferences all over the world. We love to learn and share knowledge, and you\u2019ll find a community of passionate technologists eager to back your endeavors, whatever they may be. You\u2019ll also receive financial support to attend conferences every year. * An organizational commitment to social responsibility. ThoughtWorkers challenge each other to be just a little more thoughtful about the world around us, and we believe in using our profits for good. All around the world, you\u2019ll find ThoughtWorks supporting great causes and organizations in both official and unofficial capacities. A few important things to know: - * Travel is required. Projects are almost exclusively on customer site, so ThoughtWorkers need to be flexible and up for extensive travel. Most of our consultants travel every week and fly home for weekends. We do our best to take people\u2019s personal situations into account, but we know it\u2019s not for everyone. * Residing near one of our North America offices in Chicago, Dallas, New York, Atlanta or San Francisco is preferable although not necessary.

With product teams in Austin, Tokyo, Seattle, San Francisco, Singapore and Hyderabad, we are improving people's lives all around the world, one job at a time.\n\nYour job:\nAs a Product Manager at Indeed, you will collaborate with engineers, data scientists and other relevant functions to help Indeed better measure and deliver value to job seekers and employers. You will be part of a team with an ambitious vision to help people get jobs in new ways. This is an exciting opportunity for someone passionate about how data can help build positive experiences and solve hard problems impacting millions of people.\n\nYou will be responsible for setting big goals that inspire and motivate the team while leading by example. You, not the CEO or the VP of Product, will define success and the process for achieving it.\n\nProduct development at Indeed is an iterative process. We challenge ourselves every single day to look for insights in our data, generate insightful hypotheses about our users and their needs, and run simple tests to check our hypotheses and learn about what to do next. We are fans of minimum viable process and operate using lean startup and agile principles to guide us. We would prefer to spend time simplifying a feature to get it out the door this week than building flashy powerpoint decks for all hands meetings.\n\nAbout you:\nWe're not looking for someone who meets a set of requirements exactly. We're more interested in what unique insights you\u2019ll bring to our team in a few key areas.\n\n\nYou have 3+ years of experience as a Product Manager, ideally on teams building platforms or data science infrastructure. We build products based on data, hypotheses, and MVPs, not on our opinions or our seniority. We want you to contribute in the same way.\nYou have experience formulating hypotheses, then designing, running, and analyzing A/B tests to validate them. You have a practical understanding of good experimental design and statistical concepts related to hypothesis testing.\nYou are comfortable using programming tools to explore data when necessary because you ask questions that can't always be answered using analytics dashboards. We use lots of Python and relational database concepts here, but the specific tools are less important than your ability to extract insights from challenging data.\nYou have expertise in at least a few machine learning or data mining arenas, and familiarity with many others. You don\u2019t need to implement models from scratch or have formulas memorized, but you should be able to clearly explain concepts like precision and recall or cross validation to non-experts.\nYou have strong interpersonal skills. Data is how we make decisions here, but we believe that collaboration, teamwork, and communication are critical to that process. Evangelizing our platform across multiple teams at Indeed, gathering requirements and prioritizing customer needs will be a strong component of your success.\n\n", "Apply to this job on the Verily Life Sciences career site at Verily Careers.\nFor more information about this role please see the Verily Life Sciences career site above.\nAt Google, we don\u2019t just accept difference - we celebrate it, we support it, and we thrive on it for the benefit of our employees, our products and our community.

You have a practical understanding of good experimental design and statistical concepts related to hypothesis testing.\nYou are comfortable using programming tools to explore data when necessary because you ask questions that can't always be answered using analytics dashboards. We use lots of Python and relational database concepts here, but the specific tools are less important than your ability to extract insights from challenging data.\nYou have expertise in at least a few machine learning or data mining arenas, and familiarity with many others. You don\u2019t need to implement models from scratch or have formulas memorized, but you should be able to clearly explain concepts like precision and recall or cross validation to non-experts.\nYou have strong interpersonal skills.

You have a practical understanding of good experimental design and statistical concepts related to hypothesis testing.\nYou are comfortable using programming tools to explore data when necessary because you ask questions that can't always be answered using analytics dashboards.

We've come a long way, but our future is even brighter than what we've accomplished so far.\n\nWith the ability to search thousands of vehicles from our expansive inventory, to high-resolution 360\u00b0 photographs of our vehicles' interior and exterior, to real-time financing and the ability to complete contracts without visiting the back room of a dealership, we provide a seamless, online car buying experience for consumers that can be completed from their desktop or mobile device.

It is the most important role in the product group and arguably more important to the day to day functioning of the organization than the Product Owner. They will bring an analytic mindset to uncovering sources of risk to the product and customers. A TPM will need to be compassionate and level-headed towards team members within the Manta group while at the same time being unapologetic about making sure the customer\u2019s needs are met. At times this role will be supervisory, at times it will be solitary and require contemplation of data. The TPM will determine their own day to day activities with the singular mindset of ensuring customer satisfaction.\n\nCustomer Advocacy\nFirst and foremost the TPM will represent the interests of the customer within the Manta product group. They will actively attempt to steer all work towards providing the most value for the customers. The TPM is expected to be stubborn in the face of challenges when the customer\u2019s needs aren\u2019t being met. Moreover, the TPM will work to reduce risk that is transferred from the product to the customer\u2019s business.\n\nResponsibility and Clarity of Thought\nIn teams that span geographies and cultures, there tends to be a diffusion of responsibility effect where individuals allow other people to take responsibility so that they do not have to. This happens without many people noticing it. Concretely, you can have meetings where no one has complete understanding of what was discussed because everyone thinks that it is someone else\u2019s job. It is the TPM\u2019s responsibility that we come to precise clarity on all of the customer expectations - stated or unstated and to hold the greater team accountable to those expectations. This will require an uncommon level of perseverance and stubbornness.\n\nTechnical Depth\nThe TPM needs considerable technical depth in order to properly analyze the different sources of risk to the customer. Topic areas include but are not limited to: security practices, file systems, distributed systems, databases, algorithms, networks and hardware. Ideally, the TPM is a rock-solid generalist who can sniff out practices within the organization that lead to increased risk.\n\nTrade-off Analysis Review\nThe TPM will be responsible for analyzing the trade-off analysis reports done by product managers and determining if they are acceptable trade-offs for the customer. When unacceptable, the TPM will actively work with others to discover a solution.\n\nRisk Analysis\nThis role will require structured thinking about the threats to the customer\u2019s business by failures in the product. For example, if QA is not including a performance impact test to a new feature that is being released, it would be the TPM\u2019s role to attempt to catch that problem before the feature was released. They would ideally catch risk before it was increased by: reviewing product roadmaps, PRDs, incidents, bugs, development practices, QA practices, the SDLC, deployment practices and customer communication practices. The TPM should have a global view of the day to day operations of the product group and be a careful guardian of the customer.\n\nAuthority\nOutside of the Product Owner, the TPM holds the greatest authority within the product group. The TPM can overrule any other member of the group, but will reserve their authority for only the most egregious cases. They will act as a servant to the group as a whole and attempt to guide them towards a mindset of customer centric product development.\n\nCompetitive Understanding\nThe TPM should be able to make a steelman argument in favor of a customer using competing technology. The TPM will be constantly educating themselves on the features, prices and technological underpinnings of competing products. At anytime the TPM should be able to give the product group a realistic assessment about where their product sits in the market relative to customer value.\n\nCounseling and Guidance to the Product Owner\nThe TPM will be the Product Owner\u2019s trusted advisor for the oversight of the entire organization. They will collaborate with the Product Owner about how to improve the organization and how to measure the performance of the organization.\n\nExperience\nThe TPM will ideally have the following experience:\n5+ years of experience as a software engineer as an individual contributor\n3+ years of experience in management (managing 10+ people)\n1 year of experience in a customer facing or product management role\n2 years of experience working in a dysfunctional organization that changed to a functional organization\nExperience creating development processes\nExperience creating quality processes\nExperience creating release processes\nExperience working in an pure operations organization or in a devops model\nAn ideal TPM candidate may also have the following experience:\nWorked as a turnaround consultant/expert\nExperience with cloud computing, systems software, distributed systems or storage\nWorked actively in a risk-management role", "Position Description\nWith about 600 Sam\u2019s Club locations, we offer over 47 million customers more of what they love for less.
